# Data Science
Fundamental of Data Science final project (semester 3)

> **Note**: This is ongoing undergraduate research. 

## Dataset
For this research, I use the data from January 2024 to December 2024 
- Original plan was using lichess dataset: [Lichess](https://database.lichess.org/)

However the file size is too big, that I change it to a filtered version which is [Lichess Elite](https://database.nikonoel.fr/) . 

## Baseline
This is a chess prediction where a chess game can have three outcome:

1. **Random guessing: 33.3%** (win/loss/draw)
2. **First move win: 43.4%** (white move first in all game)
3. **Rating gap only: 57.85%** (using logistic regression)

## Results
  
**Model Performance by Game Depth**

> Only tested with one random_state = 42 and constraints are no player history, no search and all are 2300++ ELO games
 
| Move Depth | XGBoost | Neural Network (MLP) | Random Forest | Logistic Regression | Decision Tree |
|------------|---------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Pre-game only** (no moves) | 58.31% | 58.28% | 58.12% | 58.12% | 57.32% |
| **First 10 moves** (20 half-moves) | 58.55% | 60.02% | 58.52% | 58.19% | 57.37% |
| **First 20 moves** (40 half-moves) | 60.01% | 60.02% | 59.89% | 59.17% | 57.51% |
| **First 30 moves** (60 half-moves) | 62.69% | 62.79% | 62.55% | 61.15% | 59.29% |
| **First 35 moves** (70 half-moves) | 63.19% | 63.25% | 63.08% | 61.74% | 59.66% |
| **First 40 moves** (80 half-moves) | 63.64% | 63.74% | 63.55% | 61.84% | 59.57% |
| **All moves** (full game) | 81.71% | **90.58%** | 81.95% | 73.72% | 83.28% |

**At 60 half-moves with Stockfish evaluation added as a feature:**
> This is using 150k sample and 0.2s movetime

| Model | No Engine | With Stockfish |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| XGBoost | 62.69% | 62.87% |
| Neural Network | 62.79% | 62.33% |
| Random Forest | 62.55% | 62.33% |
| Logistic Regression | 61.15% | 61.47% |
| Decision Tree | 59.29% | 55.19% |

### Why 80 moves ?
Game length distribution from 3.27M with all being 2300++ ELO games:

- **Mean**: 87.5 half-moves
- **Median**: 81 half-moves

| Game Phase | Move Range | Games | Percentage |
|------------|------------|-------|------------|
| Opening | ≤20 moves | 27,370 | 0.8% |
| Early-Mid | 21-40 moves | 227,627 | 7.0% |
| Midgame | 41-60 moves | 612,500 | 18.7% |
| Late-Mid | 61-80 moves | 747,638 | 22.9% |
| Endgame | 81+ moves | 1,652,998 | 50.6% |
